# project for assignment

My project is about an information Satellite Center.

It's main talking point is the use of 3D spheres, and making it rotate around a point.

I also liked how I dealth with my functionalities, as it proved to be quite smooth and easy to use.


I used royalty free sounds, and took information from the wiki pages of satellites and http://www.telescope.org/nuffield/pas/moon/moon9e.html.
